# Face-ID-Algorithm-TSVD-I

This repository includes an algorithm for facial recognition.

To test both of the algorithms, 5 expressions per 6 persons is taken from the Yale Face Database (grand total of 30 images) "glasses", "happy", "normal", "sad", "surprised" for subjects: 01, 02, 04, 05, 07, 14

First three expressions of the first three persons are taken for the training data set; other images are testing images.
